            Motorcycle groups are not just about fun and speed — for these two bikers, it's more about<br>
            freedom and camaraderie.

            <li>
            From raising money for charity to exploring untouched destinations, Yanisa, 43, and Mick, <br>
            who is in his 50s, have had some epic adventures with their riding buddies and, of course,<br>
            their trusty Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
            </li>
            <li>
            Their inspirational stories came to light during Harley-Davidson's #HDFreedomStoriesAsia <br>
            crowdsourcing campaign last July and August, which called for contributions from riders <br>
            around the region.<br>
            <br>        
            
            Speaking to AsiaOne, the two Thai riders delve deeper into their hobby, which has now<br>
            turned into a way of life.

                   her riding group's only woman.<br><br>
    
    
                  Yanisa, who works as a distributor in the<br> 
                  construction materials industry, is no stranger to <br>
                  getting around on a motorcycle. But it was only in <br>
                  March 2020 that she began to take it seriously as <br>
                  a hobby as she had "nothing to do" during the<br>
                  pandemic.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In fact, she was so serious about it that she sprang for her dream ride, a Pan America.<br>
    
                    <li>"I have always dreamed that if I could afford a nice motorcycle one day, it would be a Harley-<br>
                        Davidson," Yanisa says, adding that the bike is "such a classic".</li>
    
                    <li>Rather than using her bike just to commute, however, Yanisa began taking trips to the Thai<br>
                        countryside to immerse herself in nature. She particularly loves the northern provinces of Chiang<br>
                        Mai, Chiang Rai and Nan.</li>
    
                    <li>"Because I am so fond of nature, and most of the places we go to are very difficult to reach by<br>
                        car," explains Yanisa.</li>
                        
                    
                    <li>"Getting dirty, falling, or being a bit hurt is so fun."

                <h1>Riding is a family affair</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gaming consultant Mick isn't the only motorcycle enthusiast in his family.</li>
                     
                    <li>Mick, the assistant director of the Harley Owners' Group (HOG) Chiang Mai Chapter, says that <br>
                        not only does his wife ride on "almost every trip", but his eight-year-old son also tags along on<br> 
                        some of his shorter expeditions.</li>
                        
                    <li>Another constant in Mick's trips is his Road Glide — he tells us proudly that he's covered over<br> 
                        40,000km over the past two years, and he's not slowing down.
                        
                    <li>Eventually, the goal is to visit every single province in Thailand, he says.</li>
                        
                    <li>"Not just passing through but living and covering all the interesting spots in every province."</li>
                        
                    <li>Mick's bucket list also includes destinations that are a bit more far-flung. Think Cambodia,<br> 
                        Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the famed Route 66 in the United States.</li>
                        
                    <li>"Riding has no definition nor exact meaning to it, you need to be on the bike to know that<br> 
                        feeling," he says in an attempt to explain the allure of exploring uncharted territory on two<br> 
                        wheels. "As for me, it's the freedom in the open road and that connection to the surroundings,<br> 
                        and it isn't about the destination that you are riding to, but the satisfaction in between."</li>
                        
                    <li>Despite the exotic destinations on his bucket list, Mick tells us that his most memorable trip so far<br>
                        has been a local one.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Yanisa's and Mick's stories are just two of the many uncovered during the<br>
                        #HDFreedomStoriesAsia crowd sourcing campaign. As part of the initiative, riders from Korea,<br>
                        Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and<br> 
                        Indonesia took to social media to share all about their journeys as Harley-Davidson riders, and<br> 
                        what Harley-Davidson means to them.</li>
                    <li>Besides celebrating Harley-Davidson riders in the region who share a deep-rooted <br>
                        relationship with the brand, the campaign also aimed to spotlight the camaraderie forged<br> 
                        between them on the open road and inspire a new wave of riders.
                    </li>
                    <li>The winning riders with the most unique and compelling stories were selected to be featured<br> 
                        in Freedom Stories 2.0, a series of short films which served to preserve their treasured<br> 
                        memories and inspire the next generation of riders.</li>
    
                    <li>If you've enjoyed reading all about Mick and Yanisa so far, the films, which focus on each<br>
                        rider's life, first rides, passions and their love for motorcycles, will be right up your alley.</li>
